This project addresses the complexities of Vision-Based Underwater Docking for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). It confronts challenges inherent in underwater environments, such as turbid water, light scattering, low visibility in deep oceanic regions, and environmental pollution. The primary objective is to develop a robust detection algorithm capable of excelling in adverse underwater conditions. State-of-the-art detection algorithms, including YOLO v8 and Detection Transformer, are leveraged to enhance accuracy, with a particular focus on overcoming data limitations through innovative approaches.

The research explores the potential of cutting-edge technologies, particularly the Detection Transformer, in providing superior results compared to traditional methods like YOLO. Rigorous experimentation is conducted to validate the efficacy of these algorithms in underwater docking station detection, with an emphasis on achieving high accuracy even with limited training data.

In the second phase of the project, attention shifts to pose estimation for the detected docking stations by the AUV using computer vision techniques. This involves the application of camera calibration and pose estimation methodologies to facilitate precise docking maneuvers. The ultimate goal is to enable AUVs to autonomously navigate and dock accurately with underwater stations, thereby contributing significantly to advancements in autonomous underwater exploration and operations.

The outcomes of this research hold promise for a wide range of applications. In marine exploration, the ability to reliably detect and dock at underwater stations is crucial for mapping and studying underwater ecosystems. In environmental monitoring, precise AUV docking facilitates data collection in challenging underwater environments. Additionally, in underwater infrastructure maintenance, autonomous docking capabilities contribute to the efficiency and success of various tasks.

In summary, this comprehensive study aims to advance the capabilities of AUVs in autonomous underwater missions through the development and validation of innovative vision-based algorithms for docking station detection and pose estimation. The project's outcomes are anticipated to have far-reaching implications across diverse industries, supporting advancements in underwater exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure maintenance.
